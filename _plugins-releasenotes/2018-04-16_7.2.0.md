# Release overview 

### Archive search plugin has support for finding images in Editorial OC
Previously, the archive search had support for getting images from Open Content Archives, where binaries are stored in Open Content. Now support has been extended to allow search in Editorial Open Content.

### Smart date display in related search plugin
Previously, the publication and updated date was reported in the same was as the Newsday Planner cards, with only the time part of the timestamp. Now the report is reported using the calendar date functionality in moment js, that is with a higher precision when the actual timestamp is near the current time, and with year-month-date if the timestamp happened more than a week ago.

### Extended support for Editorial Open Content in Digital Job plugin
It is now possible to mark specific store locations in Digital to be of type Editorial Open Content. This means that images in the Job and originates from a Digital Writer article are now possible to drag/drop into another article.

### Download original image in Writer
There is a download button, visible in among the image tools when an image is selected, that gives the possiblilty to download the original image to the local file system.

### Extended API for plugins to act on Concept operations through Concept Service
It is possible, as a plugin, to register handlers in concept service to receive notifications on concept operations, for example when a concept is added to an article.

### Concecpts plugin timing issue is resolved
Previously, a search result from a previous keystroke could overwrite the search result from the most recent search. Also, the results were not properly updated when a search resulted in no matches. The problem was mostly noticable when internet connection was slow.

### Navigational issues resolved for concept plugins
There was an error in the concept plugins when navigating using tab or arrows, which put the plugin in a non-responsive state. This is now fixed.
