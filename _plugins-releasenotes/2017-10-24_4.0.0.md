## Upgrade notes  
        
### WPLUG-122 Preview rendered softcrops in the writer 
Requires Writer ≥3.7.0
Requires EditorService ≥3.6


Requires changes in configuration. See https://github.com/Infomaker/NPWriterPluginBundle/tree/4.0.0/plugins/se.infomaker.ximimage    
### WPLUG-121 Message to user when trying to upload image of unsupported format 
- Disallow uploading unsupported image types from file dialog.
- Display notifications when trying to upload unsupported image types.      
### WPLUG-94 Add opengraph as it's own teaser, or integrated with the current teaser 
Teaser plugin has been replaced by Multi teaser plugin.
Plugin configuration for `se.infomaker.ximteaser` needs to 
be updated to make it work correctly. 

For basic teaser functionality, like the old teaser plugin, 
use the following config example and edit the fields as needed.
