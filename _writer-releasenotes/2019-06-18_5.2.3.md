# Changes in this release  


### New Feature 



### Improvement 



### Bug 
 
 * [WRIT-912](https://jira.infomaker.se/browse/WRIT-912) - Access-Control-Allow-Origin is not set when writer is called from Dashboard without imid 




# Upgrade notes  
          
### WRIT-912 Access-Control-Allow-Origin is not set when writer is called from Dashboard without imid 
## Environment variable change

The `ALLOW_ORIGIN` variable previously documented as `infomaker.io` actually needs to be even more specific, it needs to include the full path to the allowed resource like: `https://dashboard.infomaker.io` or `https://stage.dashboard.infomaker.io`
